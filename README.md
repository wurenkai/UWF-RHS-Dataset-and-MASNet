**0. Main Environments.**
- python 3.8
- pytorch 1.12.0

**1. The proposed datasets (UWF-RHS).** </br>
(1) To obtain the UWF-RHS dataset, you need to provide **your name, affiliation, reason for applying (one sentence description of your work), and an assurance that you will not share the dataset privately. Specifically, complete the information in the following format** and send it to 'wurk@shu.edu.cn' with the subject name '**UWF-RHS dataset request**'. We will usually review your request and provide you with a link within 3 days. If you do not register your information as required, your application may fail. Please understand! </br>
```
Name:
Affiliation:
Reason for applying (one sentence description of your work):
I (the applicant) guarantee that the data will be used only for academic communication and not for any commercial purposes. I (the applicant) guarantee that I will not privately disseminate the data to any public place without the consent of the author.
```

**2. Train the MASNet.**
```
python train.py
```
- After trianing, you could obtain the outputs in './results/'

**3. Test the MASNet.** </br>
First, in the test.py file, you should change the address of the checkpoint in 'resume_model' and fill in the location of the test data in 'data_path'.
```
python test.py
```
- After testing, you could obtain the outputs in './results/'
